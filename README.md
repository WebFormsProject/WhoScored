## Who Scored ##
A simple football-related ASP.NET WebForms application.

 All of the users can see our football leagues, teams, scores, players
 and trolling photos. 
 Those, who are registered, have their own profile
 page and can upload some more troll photos. 
 In the admin area, there
 is a menu for adding, editing or deleting all the information from the
 tables.
